# Library Management System

The **Library Management System** is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline the operations of libraries. This project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for managing books, members, loans, and various library activities. It leverages key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, making it a robust and scalable solution suitable for libraries of all sizes.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration (signup) for administrators and library members.
- **Book Management:** Add, update, delete, and search for books with ease. Track book availability and manage book categories.
- **Show All Books:** Display a list of all books in the database.
- **PDF Upload:** Upload book PDFs to the database for easy access and viewing.
- **Member Management:** Maintain detailed records of library members, including personal information and borrowing history.
- **Loan Management:** Issue and return books efficiently, track due dates, and manage overdue books with automated notifications.
- **Borrow History:** View the borrowing history to track which users have borrowed specific books.
- **PDF Viewing:** View books in PDF format directly within the GUI.
- **Issue Reporting:** Report any issues or problems encountered within the system.
- **Reports and Analytics:** Generate detailed reports on library activities, including book circulation, member activity, and overdue fines.
- **User Management:** Administrators can add, remove, and manage users.
- **Dark Theme:** Optional dark theme for the user interface to reduce eye strain.
- **Search Functionality:** Search for books by name to quickly find the desired book.
- **Return Books:** Users can return books, but they must pay any outstanding bills before doing so.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface designed to enhance the user experience for both staff and members.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Built with scalability in mind, allowing for future enhancements and integration with other systems.
